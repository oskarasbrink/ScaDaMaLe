    "Music Recommendation System\n",
    "===========================\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, [recommender\n",
    "systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) are\n",
    "algorithms designed for suggesting relevant items/products to users. In\n",
    "the last decades they have gained much interest because of the potential\n",
    "of increasing the user experience at the same time as generating more\n",
    "profit to companies. Nowadays, these systems can be found in several\n",
    "well-known services like Netfilx, Amazon, YouTube and Spotify. As an\n",
    "indicator of how valuable these algorithms are for such companies: back\n",
    "in 2006 Netflix announced the open [Netflix Prize\n",
    "Competition](https://www.netflixprize.com/) for the best algorithm to\n",
    "predict users movie ratings based on collected data. The winning team\n",
    "with the best algorithm improving the state-of-the-art performance with\n",
    "at least 10% was promised an award of 1 000 000$. **In this notebook we\n",
    "are going to develope a system for recommending musical artists to users\n",
    "given their listening history**. We will implement a model related to\n",
    "matrix factorization discussed in the preceeding notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Setting\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We let $U$ be the set containing all $m$ users and let $I$ be the set\n",
    "containing all $n$ available items. Now, we introduce the matrix $R\\\\in\n",
    "\\\\mathbb{R}^{m \\\\times n}$ with elements $r{*u}{*i}$ as a value encoding\n",
    "a possible interaction between user $u\\\\in U$ and item $i \\\\in I$. This\n",
    "matrix is often very sparse because of the huge number of possible\n",
    "user-item interactions never observed. Depending on the type of\n",
    "information encoded in the interaction matrix $R$ one usally refers to\n",
    "either *explicit* or *implicit* data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For explicit data, the $r{*u}{*i}$ contains information directly related\n",
    "to user $u$'s preference for item $i$, e.g movie ratings. In the case of\n",
    "implicit data, $r{*u}{*i}$ contains indirect information of a users\n",
    "preference for an item by observing past user behavior. Examples could\n",
    "be the number of times a user played a song or visited a webpage. Note\n",
    "that in the implicit case we are lacking information about items that\n",
    "the user dislikes because if a user of a music service has not played\n",
    "any songs from a particular artist it could either mean that the user\n",
    "simply doesn't like that artist or that the user hasn't encountered that\n",
    "artist before but would potentially like it if the user had discovered\n",
    "that artist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the observations in the interaction matrix $R$, we would like our\n",
    "model to suggest unseen items relevant to the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, recommender algorithms can be divided into two\n",
    "categories: [content\n",
    "based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#Content-based_filtering)\n",
    "and [collaborative\n",
    "filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) (CF).\n",
    "Here, we will just focus on collaborative filtering which is a technique\n",
    "using patterns of user-item interactions and disregarding any additional\n",
    "information about the user or item themselves. It is based on the\n",
    "assumption that if a user similar to you likes an item, then there is a\n",
    "high probability that you also like that particular item. In other\n",
    "words, similar users have similar taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different approaches to CF, and we have chosen a laten factor\n",
    "model approach inspired by low-rank SVD factorization of matrices. The\n",
    "aim is to uncover latent features explaining the observed $r{*u}{*i}$\n",
    "values. Each user $u$ is associated to a user-feature vector $x{*u}\\\\in\n",
    "\\\\mathbb{R}^f$ and similarly each item $i$ is associated to a\n",
    "item-feature vector $y{*i} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^f$. Then we want the dot\n",
    "products $x{*u}^Ty{*i}$ to explain the observed $r{*u}{*i}$ values. With\n",
    "all user- and item-features at hand in the latent space $R^f$ we can\n",
    "estimate a user $u$'s preference for an unseen item $j$ by simply\n",
    "computing $x{*u}^Ty{*j}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We transorm the problem of finding the vectors $x{*u}, y{*i}$ into a\n",
    "minimization problem as suggested in the paper [Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "for Implicit Feedback\n",
    "Datasets](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220765111_Collaborative_Filtering_for_Implicit_Feedback_Datasets).\n",
    "First we introduce the binarized quantitiy $p{*u}{*i}$ defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p*{ui}=\\\\begin{cases}1 \\\\text{ if } r*{ui}&gt;0, \\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\text{ if }\n",
    "r*{ui}=0,\\\\end{cases}$$ encoding whether user $u$ has interacted with\n",
    "and supposedly likes item $i$. However, our confidence that user $u$\n",
    "likes item $i$ given that $p{*u}{*i}=1$ should vary with the actual\n",
    "$r{*u}{*i}$ value. As an example, we would be more confident that a user\n",
    "likes an artist he/she has listened to hundreds of times than an artist\n",
    "played by the user only once. Therefore we introduce the confidence\n",
    "$c{*u}{\\_i}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c*{ui}=1+\\\\alpha r*{ui}$$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\\\alpha$ is a hyperparameter. From the above equation we can see\n",
    "that the confidence for non observed user-item interaction defaults to\n",
    "1. Now we formulize the minimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\\\min*{X,Y}\\\\sum*{u\\\\in U,i \\\\in\n",
    "I}c*{ui}(p*{ui}-x*u^Ty*i)^2+\\\\lambda(\\\\sum*{u\\\\in\n",
    "U}||x*u||^2+\\\\sum*{i\\\\in I}||y*i||^2),$$ where $X,Y$ are matrices\n",
    "holding the $x*u,y*i$ as columns respectively. Notice the regularization\n",
    "term in the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "For this application we use a\n",
    "[dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/) containing\n",
    "user-artist listening information from the online music service\n",
    "[Last.fm](http://www.last.fm).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the available files contains triplets (`userID` `artistID`\n",
    "`play_count`) describing the number of times a user has played an\n",
    "artist. Another file contains tuples (`artistID` `name`) mapping the\n",
    "artistID:s to actual artist names. There are a total of 92834 (`userID`\n",
    "`artistID` `play_count`) triplets containing 1892 unique `userID`s and\n",
    "17632 unique `artistID`s. Since the observations in the dataset do not\n",
    "contain direct information about artist preferences, this is an implicit\n",
    "dataset viewed from the description above. Based on this dataset we want\n",
    "our model to give artist recommendations to the users."
