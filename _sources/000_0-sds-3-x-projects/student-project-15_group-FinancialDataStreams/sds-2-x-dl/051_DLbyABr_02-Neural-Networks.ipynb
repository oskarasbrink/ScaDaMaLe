    "\n",
    "-   How do we know how far to \"adjust\" our parameters with each step?\n",

    "\n",
    "Yes: *Stochastic Gradient Descent*\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic gradient descent is an iterative learning algorithm that uses\n",
    "a training dataset to update a model. - The batch size is a\n",
    "hyperparameter of gradient descent that controls the number of training\n",
    "samples to work through before the model's internal parameters are\n",

    "of SGD, which has rules for adjusting the learning rate and even\n",

    "\n",
    "What about that \"Adam\" optimizer? Adam is short for \"adaptive moment\"\n",
    "and is a variant of SGD that includes momentum calculations that change\n",
    "over time. For more detail on optimizers, see the chapter \"Training Deep\n",
    "Neural Nets\" in Aurélien Géron's book: *Hands-On Machine Learning with\n",

    "\n",
    "### Training: Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "With a simple, flat model, we could use SGD or a related algorithm to\n",
    "derive the weights, since the error depends directly on those weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a deeper network, we have a couple of challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The error is computed from the final layer, so the gradient of the\n",
    "    error doesn't tell us immediately about problems in other-layer\n",
    "    weights\n",
    "-   Our tiny diamonds model has almost a thousand weights. Bigger models\n",
    "    can easily have millions of weights. Each of those weights may need\n",
    "    to move a little at a time, and we have to watch out for underflow\n",
    "    or undersignificance situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The insight is to iteratively calculate errors, one layer at a time,\n",
    "starting at the output. This is called backpropagation. It is neither\n",
    "magical nor surprising. The challenge is just doing it fast and not\n",

    "\n",
    "### Where does the non-linearity fit in?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We start with the inputs to a perceptron -- these could be from\n",
    "    source data, for example.\n",
    "-   We multiply each input by its respective weight, which gets us the\n",
    "    $x \\\\cdot w$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Where does the signal \"go\" from these neurons?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In a regression problem, like the diamonds dataset, the activations\n",

    "    simple linear activation representing the final output of the\n",

    "-   Frequently we want a classification output instead -- e.g., with\n",

    "1.  The second (hidden) layer is learning features composed of\n",
    "    activations in the first (hidden) layer\n",
    "2.  The first (hidden) layer is learning feature weights that enable the\n",
    "    second layer to perform best\n",
    "    -   Why? Earlier, the first hidden layer just learned feature\n",
    "        weights because that's how it was judged\n",
    "    -   Now, the first hidden layer is judged on the error in the second\n",
    "        layer, so it learns to contribute to that second layer\n",
